"""
To establish a typical remote shell, a machine controlled by the attacker 
connects to a remote network host and requests a shell session â€“ this is called 
a bind shell. But what if the remote host is not directly accessible, for example 
because it has no public IP or is protected by a firewall? In this situation, a 
reverse shell might be used, where the target machine initiates an outgoing connection 
to a listening network host and a shell session is established.

Reverse shells are often the only way to perform remote maintenance on hosts behind a NAT,
so they have legitimate administrative uses. However, they can also be used by cybercriminals 
to execute operating system commands on hosts protected from incoming connections by a firewall 
or other network security systems. For example, a piece of malware installed on a local
workstation via a phishing email or a malicious website might initiate an outgoing connection
to a command server and provide hackers with a reverse shell capability. Firewalls mostly filter 
incoming traffic, so an outgoing connection to a listening server will often succeed.

When attempting to compromise a server, an attacker may try to exploit a command injection vulnerability 
on the server system. The injected code will often be a reverse shell script to provide a convenient command
shell for further malicious activities.
